## Description
A command line application that allows a user to view an organized table of employees and their roles, add new employees to the database, and update any existing employee information. This application utilizes [inquirer](https://www.npmjs.com/package/inquirer/v/8.2.4), [mysql](https://www.npmjs.com/package/mysql), [mysql2](https://www.npmjs.com/package/mysql2), and [console.table](https://www.npmjs.com/package/console.table) to run.


## Installation
To install this application, clone the project locally and make sure to install the following dependencies:

* ```npm install inquirer@8.2.4```
* ```npm i mysql```
* ```npm i mysql2```
* ```npm i console.table```

Or, simply run ```npm install```


## Usage
Once the above dependencies are installed, run ```node server.js``` and you will be prompted with the options to view, add, update, or exit.

From there, you will be able to view all employees, add a department, a role, or an employee, and you will be able to update any existing employee's information within the database.
